I am a graduate student studying Political Science and International Relations at the American University of Armenia. Here you may find some of my writings and working papers -- probably political in their kind most of the time. Occasionally I may post other materials as well, as I enjoy other activities, too. These include but are not limited to foreign languages, drawing, graphic design and scripting (computers).

For contacting me, you may use this public e-mail address: [public-affairs@t-online.de](mailto:public-affairs@t-online.de).

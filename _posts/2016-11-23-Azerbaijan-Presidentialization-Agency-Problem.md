The principal–agent problem is found in cases, when an actor—identified as ‘agent’—has the ability and uses its ability to make decisions and act on behalf of another entity—identified as ‘principal’ (Eisenhardt, 1989). This problem is also known as agency dilemma or agency theory. The agent always has interests, that are independent of and different from the interests of the principal. Thus, whenever the agent discovers that it is possible to avoid its duties or to accomplish them in a manner, which will meet his or her interest at the expense of confronting the interests of the principal, then he or she will most probably do it so (Eisenhardt, 1989).

Having defined what the principal–agent problem is, we may proceed with the discussion of the concept of presidentialization, where this problem will be applied and empirically analyzed. The presidentialization is “the strengthening of the chief executive vis-à-vis political parties” (Muller, 2014). This definition is the most simple answer to what the presidentialization is. However, there were other scholars who studied it more systematical and came up with conclusion that it is associated with “(1) increasing leadership power resources and autonomy within the party and the political executive respectively, and (2) increasingly leadership-centered electoral processes” (Poguntke & Webb, 2005).

For the discussion and analysis, Azerbaijan will be selected with its two constitutional reforms in 2009 and 2016. Azerbaijani reforms were criticized by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe. They were also highly criticized in the popular discourse, and the Azerbaijani regime was called “monarchical presidentialism” (Presidential Power, 2016). In fact, Azerbaijani case is an excellent example depicting the second association of the presidentialization, that is Ilham Aliyev introduced reforms that are making the electoral processes to the best of his interests. Here, we may observe that he (as agent) acted in a way that will benefit him, but will confront with citizens’ (as principal) interests. With the referendum of 2009, the limit for the president being re-elected was abolished, which was thought of as “a step back in democratic achievements” (Venice Commission, 2009). In the referendum of 2016, we see quite the same approach and move toward more presidentialization. Specifically, the presidential term of service was extended from 5 to 7 years as well as the age limit to run for president was removed (Venice Commission, 2016). In this case, we see that Ilham Aliev reinforced the president’s role even more, and there may be chances that he is trying to secure the smooth transition of the office to his son.

To sum up, we may claim that presidentialization may be regarded as an act in favor of the agent in principal–agent problem. In this paper, we consider the president as the agent and the citizenry as principal. The application of the problem on the case of Azerbaijani presidentialization proved that the agent is prone to act in a way that will benefit him, even though it may be hazardous for the principal.
